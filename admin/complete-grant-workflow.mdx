## Overview

This comprehensive guide walks you through the complete process of creating grants on the TGA platform. The grant creation workflow is designed to be fully self-service, allowing you to manage token grants efficiently without requiring support intervention.

## The 4-Step Process

<Steps>
<Step title="Add Recipients">
  Set up employee/contractor profiles
</Step>
<Step title="Create Grant Type">
  Define grant categories with specific asset types, compensation types, and other properties
</Step>
<Step title="Create Vesting Template">
  Build reusable vesting schedule templates
</Step>
<Step title="Upload Grants">
  Import grant data via simplified CSV template
</Step>
</Steps>

## Prerequisites

Before you begin creating grants, ensure you have:

- Administrative access to the TGA platform
- Complete recipient information (personal email addresses, full names, employee IDs, countries, and employment type)
- Grant details (amounts, grant dates, vesting terms)
- Tax reporting requirements determined

<Tip>
The new system separates grant configuration from grant assignment. You'll set up your grant types and vesting schedules once, then reuse them for multiple grant uploads.
</Tip>

## Step 1: Add Recipients

Recipients must be added to the system before grants can be assigned to them. This is a one-time setup per recipient.

### How to Add Recipients

<Steps>
<Step title="Log in to TGA">
  Log in to your Toku TGA account at [tga.app.toku.com](https://tga.app.toku.com)
</Step>

<Step title="Navigate to Recipients">
  On the sidebar menu, select **People Directory**, then navigate to the **Recipients** section.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Add New Recipient">
  Click the **Add New Recipient** button.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/Screenshot_2025-12-29_at_1.44.40_PM.png" alt="Add New Recipient button" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Enter Recipient Information">
  Fill in the required information:

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/Screenshot_2025-12-29_at_1.47.41_PM.png" alt="Recipient information form" />
  </Frame>

  <Warning>
  **Important**: Email addresses serve as the primary identifier for grant assignments. Recipients must provide their **personal email addresses** rather than company email addresses. This ensures continued access to TGA accounts after an employee leaves the organization.
  </Warning>
</Step>

<Step title="Create the Recipient">
  Once the information is complete, click the **Create** button.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Sending Activation Emails

After adding a new recipient, you must send them an activation email:

1. On the **Recipients** page, use the search bar to find the recipient
2. In the **Actions** column, click the **Send Invitation** button (blue envelope icon)
3. A confirmation notification will appear once the email is sent

<Warning>
Always verify the recipient's email address is correct before sending. Toku is not responsible for activation emails sent to incorrect addresses.
</Warning>

## Step 2: Create Grant Type

Grant types define the fundamental characteristics of your grants, including the asset type, compensation type, and other properties.

### Understanding Grant Types

Grant types specify:

| Property | Description |
|----------|-------------|
| **Asset type** | Whether grants are denominated in tokens or fiat currency |
| **Compensation type** | Paid in token or cash compensation |
| **Option or grant** | Whether standard grants or traditional options |
| **Performance** | Whether performance-related or non-performance related |

### Creating a Grant Type

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Grant Types">
  On the sidebar menu, select **Token Grants** > **Grant Types**.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Create New Grant Type">
  Click the **Create New Grant Type** button.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/Screenshot_2025-12-29_at_2.44.02_PM.png" alt="Create New Grant Type button" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure the Grant Type">
  Enter a descriptive name (e.g., "RTU Grant", "Performance Bonus USDC").

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/Screenshot_2025-12-29_at_2.15.31_PM.png" alt="Grant type configuration" />
  </Frame>

  Select the grant classification:
  - **Option** - Check for traditional stock options
  - **Performance Award** - Check if contingent on performance
  - **Cash Compensation** - Check if paid in cash rather than tokens
  - **Grant Asset Type** - Select Token or Fiat:
    - **Token**: Vesting calculates based on fixed token amount
    - **Fiat**: Vesting calculates based on fixed fiat amount
</Step>

<Step title="Save the Grant Type">
  Click **Create Grant Type** to save.
</Step>
</Steps>

---

## Step 3: Create Vesting Template

Vesting schedules define when tokens will vest and become available to recipients.

### Creating the Vesting Template

<Steps>
<Step title="Navigate to Vesting Templates">
  On the sidebar menu, select **Token Grants** > **Vesting Templates**.
</Step>

<Step title="Click Create Vesting Schedule">
  Click the **Create Vesting Schedule** button.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/Screenshot_2025-12-29_at_3.45.21_PM.png" alt="Create Vesting Schedule button" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Name Your Template">
  Use a clear, descriptive name that indicates its terms.

  **Examples:**
  - "Regular RTU - 36 Month Vesting, 12 Months Cliff at 50%"
  - "Regular RTU - 24 Month Vesting, 6 Months Cliff at 25%"
  - "Fiat Denominated Bonus"

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/Screenshot_2025-12-29_at_4.14.00_PM.png" alt="Vesting template naming" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Vesting Frequency">
  Choose from: daily, weekly, monthly, quarterly, semi-annually, yearly, or Custom for specific dates.
</Step>

<Step title="Set End of Month Logic">
  - **Enabled**: Vesting occurs on the last day of each month
  - **Disabled**: Vesting occurs on the same calendar day as the start date
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Vesting Tranches">
  Enter the number of periods (total vesting events including cliff).

  <Tip>
  **Example**: A 3-year grant with monthly vesting and a 1-year cliff would have 25 vesting periods. The cliff payment after 12 months counts as the first period, followed by 24 monthly vesting events.
  </Tip>

  Click **Generate** to create the tranches.
</Step>

<Step title="Configure First Tranche">
  The system generates tranches automatically. Set the first tranche allocation:
  - If the grant includes a cliff, specify the cliff percentage (e.g., 50%)
  - The system automatically distributes the remaining allocation across subsequent tranches

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/Screenshot_2025-12-29_at_4.29.43_PM.png" alt="Vesting tranches configuration" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Save the Template">
  Click **Update Template** to save.
</Step>
</Steps>

<Note>
You can edit, delete, or regenerate vesting tranches only while the template remains unused. Once grants have been issued using this template, the vesting structure is finalized.
</Note>

### Adding Unlock Schedule (Optional)

Lockups are separate from vesting and typically tied to Token Generation Events (TGE) or other milestone dates.

<Tip>
**Difference between Vesting and Unlock:**
- **Vesting** = When tokens are earned
- **Lockup/Unlock** = When vested tokens can be sold/transferred

A token can be fully vested but still locked.
</Tip>

<Steps>
<Step title="Enable Lockup Schedule">
  Check the **Enable Lockup Schedule** box.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/Screenshot_2025-12-29_at_5.48.32_PM.png" alt="Enable Lockup Schedule" />
  </Frame>
</Step>

<Step title="Configure Lockup Start Offset">
  Enter the number of days from vesting start date.
  - "0" = lockup starts same day as vesting
  - "365" = lockup begins 365 days after vesting start
</Step>

<Step title="Set Lockup Frequency">
  Choose: Daily, Monthly, Quarterly, Semi-annually, Yearly, or Custom.
</Step>

<Step title="Generate Lockup Tranches">
  Enter the number of periods and click **Generate**.
</Step>

<Step title="Save">
  Review your configuration and click **Update Template**.

  <Frame>
    <img src="/images/Screenshot_2025-12-29_at_5.44.31_PM.png" alt="Complete vesting and lockup configuration" />
  </Frame>
</Step>
</Steps>

## Best Practices

### Set Up Once, Use Many Times

- Create grant types for each category of grant you'll issue
- Build vesting schedule templates for standard terms
- Reuse templates across multiple grant uploads

### Maintain Consistent Naming

Use clear, descriptive names for:
- **Grant types and vesting templates**: Standardized naming reduces errors during bulk upload
- **Grant names**: Systematic naming enables easy tracking and searching

### Test with Small Batches First

When using the system for the first time:
1. Upload 2-3 test grants
2. Verify they appear correctly
3. Confirm vesting schedules calculate properly
4. Then proceed with full batch uploads

### Document Your Templates

Keep a reference document that maps:
- Grant types to their use cases
- Vesting schedules to their terms
- Any special configurations or edge cases
