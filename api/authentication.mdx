## Overview

The Toku API uses API keys and session-based authentication to secure access to resources. All API requests must include valid authentication credentials.

## Authentication Methods

### API Key Authentication

For server-to-server integrations, use API key authentication. Include your API key in the request headers:

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.toku.com/api/payroll/getOrgs" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer YOUR_API_KEY" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json"
```

### Session Authentication

For web applications, session-based authentication is supported through NextAuth. Contact Toku support to configure OAuth integration for your application.

## Obtaining API Keys

<Steps>
  <Step title="Contact Toku Support">
    Reach out to your Toku account representative or contact support@toku.com to request API access.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Provide Integration Details">
    Describe your use case, expected API volume, and the specific endpoints you need access to.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Receive Credentials">
    Once approved, you'll receive your API key and any additional configuration details.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Role-Based Access Control

API access is governed by role-based permissions. The available roles are:

| Role | Description | Access Level |
|------|-------------|--------------|
| `orgAdmin` | Organization Administrator | Full access to organization resources |
| `tokuOrgAdmin` | Toku Organization Admin | Access to payroll operations and management |
| `employeeAdmin` | Employee Administrator | Access to specific employee records |
| `tokuSuperAdmin` | Toku Super Admin | Full platform access (internal use) |

Your API key will be associated with one or more roles that determine which endpoints you can access.

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
Never expose your API key in client-side code or public repositories.
</Warning>

- **Keep keys secure**: Store API keys in environment variables or secure vaults
- **Rotate regularly**: Periodically rotate your API keys
- **Use HTTPS**: All API requests must use HTTPS
- **Limit scope**: Request only the permissions you need

## Request Headers

Include these headers with all API requests:

| Header | Required | Description |
|--------|----------|-------------|
| `Authorization` | Yes | `Bearer YOUR_API_KEY` |
| `Content-Type` | Yes | `application/json` |

## Example Request

```bash
curl -X GET "https://api.toku.com/api/payroll/getOrgDetails" \
  -H "Authorization: Bearer sk_live_xxxxxxxxxxxxx" \
  -H "Content-Type: application/json" \
  -d '{"orgID": 123}'
```

## Error Responses

Authentication failures return a `401 Unauthorized` status:

```json
{
  "error": {
    "code": "UNAUTHORIZED",
    "message": "Invalid or expired API key"
  }
}
```
