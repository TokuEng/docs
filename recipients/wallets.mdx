## Why Connect a Wallet?

To receive your tokens, you need to provide a wallet address. This is where your claimed tokens will be sent.

---

## Adding a Wallet

<Steps>
  <Step title="Go to Wallets">
    From your dashboard, click **Wallets** in the sidebar.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Click Add Wallet">
    Select **Add Wallet** to start the process.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Enter your address">
    Paste your wallet address. Make sure it's correct - tokens sent to the wrong address cannot be recovered.
  </Step>
  <Step title="Verify ownership">
    You may need to verify you own the wallet by signing a message or completing a small test transaction.
  </Step>
</Steps>

## Wallet Requirements

### Supported Networks
Your wallet must support the blockchain network used by your organization's tokens. Common networks include:
- Ethereum
- Polygon
- Solana
- Arbitrum
- Optimism

### Self-Custody vs. Exchange Wallets
We recommend using a self-custody wallet (like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or Phantom) rather than an exchange address for maximum control over your tokens.

<Warning>
  **Never share your private keys or seed phrase.** TGA will never ask for this information.
</Warning>

---

## Wallet Options

### Self-Custody Wallets
You control your own private keys.
- MetaMask
- Coinbase Wallet
- Phantom (Solana)
- Rainbow

### Embedded Wallets
Some organizations offer embedded wallets created within TGA. These are managed wallets that simplify the process.

### Exchange Wallets
While possible, sending to exchange wallets is not recommended as some tokens may not be supported.

---

## Managing Wallets

### Default Wallet
Your default wallet receives tokens when you claim. You can change your default at any time before claiming.

### Multiple Wallets
You can add multiple wallets and choose which one to use for each claim.

### Updating Wallets
To update a wallet address, add a new wallet and set it as default. Old wallet addresses remain in your history.

## Troubleshooting

  <Accordion title="I entered the wrong address">
    If you haven't claimed yet, simply add a new wallet with the correct address and set it as default. If tokens were already sent, contact support immediately.

  <Accordion title="Verification failed">
    Make sure you're signing with the correct wallet. The wallet address must match exactly what you entered.
