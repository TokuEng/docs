## Vesting Explained

### What is vesting?
Vesting is the process by which you earn the right to your tokens over time. Until tokens vest, they belong to your organization.

### Cliff Period
Many grants have a "cliff" - an initial period where no tokens vest. After the cliff, a portion of your tokens vest immediately.

**Example:** 4-year vesting with 1-year cliff
- Year 1: No tokens vest (cliff period)
- After 1 year: 25% of tokens vest immediately
- Years 2-4: Remaining 75% vest monthly

### Vesting Schedule
After the cliff, tokens typically vest on a regular schedule:
- **Monthly** - Tokens vest each month
- **Quarterly** - Tokens vest every 3 months
- **Annually** - Tokens vest once per year

## Grant Types

### RTU (Restricted Token Units)
Tokens that vest over time. No purchase required - once vested, they're yours.

### Options
The right to purchase tokens at a set price (strike price). You pay the strike price to exercise and receive the tokens.

### Warrants
Similar to options, typically issued to investors or advisors.

### Token Bonus
One-time token awards that vest immediately or on a specific date.
