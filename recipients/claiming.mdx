## Options & Warrants

For options and warrants, claiming involves an additional step:

### Exercise
You must "exercise" your options by paying the strike price before receiving tokens.

**Example:**
- 1,000 options with $0.10 strike price
- Exercise cost: 1,000 x $0.10 = $100
- Pay $100 to receive 1,000 tokens

### Payment Methods
Depending on your organization's setup:
- Wire transfer
- Crypto payment
- Cashless exercise (if available)

---

## Tax Considerations

<Warning>
  Token compensation may have tax implications. Consult a tax professional about your specific situation.
</Warning>

### Withholding
Your organization may withhold a portion of tokens for tax purposes. The withheld amount appears in your claim details.

### Tax Documents
Tax-related documents will be available in TGA or provided by your organization.

---

## Timing

### Processing Time
Claims are typically processed within:
- **Same day** - For most custody providers
- **1-3 business days** - For manual or multi-sig wallets

### Vesting Events
Tokens vest according to your grant's vesting schedule. Check your grant details for exact dates.
