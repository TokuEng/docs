## Token Grant Administration

### Grant
A token grant is an award of tokens to an employee, contractor, or investor. Grants typically have vesting schedules that determine when the recipient can claim their tokens.

### Vesting
Vesting is the process by which a recipient earns the right to their tokens over time. Common vesting structures include:
- **Cliff vesting** — No tokens vest until a specific date (e.g., 1 year)
- **Linear vesting** — Tokens vest evenly over time (e.g., monthly over 4 years)
- **Milestone vesting** — Tokens vest when specific goals are achieved

### Distribution
A distribution is the actual transfer of vested tokens from your organization to a recipient's wallet.

### Cap Table
A record of all token grants and ownership in your organization, showing who owns what and how much has vested.
