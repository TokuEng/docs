## For Employees

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="What is stablecoin payroll?">
    Stablecoin payroll allows you to receive part or all of your pay in stablecoins (like USDC) instead of traditional bank deposits. Stablecoins are digital currencies pegged to the US dollar.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Do I have to use stablecoin payments?">
    No, it's optional. You can continue receiving 100% of your pay via traditional bank deposit if you prefer.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What stablecoins can I receive?">
    Typically USDC, though your employer may offer other options like USDT or DAI. Check your payroll settings to see what's available.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Is it safe?">
    Stablecoins like USDC are designed to maintain a 1:1 value with USD. However, they are digital assets with some risk. The value is stable but not guaranteed by the government like bank deposits.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What wallet should I use?">
    We recommend self-custody wallets like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or Rainbow. Avoid using exchange deposit addresses as your primary wallet.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I set up a wallet?">
    Download a wallet app, create a new wallet, securely store your recovery phrase, and copy your wallet address into Toku.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Can I change my split percentage?">
    Yes, you can change how much goes to your bank vs. your wallet at any time. Changes apply to the next pay cycle.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Are stablecoin payments taxed?">
    Yes, stablecoin compensation is taxable income just like regular pay. Your employer withholds taxes the same way regardless of payment method.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What if I sent it to the wrong address?">
    Crypto sent to the wrong address typically cannot be recovered. Always double-check your wallet address before saving it.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I don't see my stablecoins in my wallet">
    Make sure you're on the correct network and that you've added the stablecoin token to your wallet. Check the transaction hash on a block explorer to confirm the transfer.
  </Accordion>
