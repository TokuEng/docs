## Overview

If your employer offers stablecoin payroll, you can choose to receive part or all of your pay in stablecoins instead of traditional bank deposits.

---

## Your Options

### Traditional (Bank Deposit)
Receive 100% of your pay via direct deposit to your bank account.

### Stablecoin
Receive part or all of your pay in stablecoins (like USDC) to your crypto wallet.

### Hybrid
Split your pay between bank deposit and stablecoin — for example, 70% to your bank and 30% in USDC.
