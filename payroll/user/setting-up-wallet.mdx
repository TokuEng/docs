## Wallet Address Tips

<Warning>
  **Triple-check your wallet address!** Crypto sent to the wrong address cannot be recovered.
</Warning>

### Do
- Copy and paste — don't type manually
- Verify the first and last several characters match
- Use a self-custody wallet (not an exchange)
- Keep your recovery phrase safe and private

### Don't
- Share your private key or recovery phrase with anyone
- Use an exchange deposit address (funds may be lost)
- Rely on memory — always verify the address

---

## Network Matching

Make sure your wallet supports the network your employer uses:

| Employer Uses | You Need |
|---------------|----------|
| USDC on Ethereum | Ethereum wallet address |
| USDC on Polygon | Same address works (EVM compatible) |
| USDC on Solana | Solana wallet address |

Most EVM-compatible networks (Ethereum, Polygon, Arbitrum) use the same address format.

## Viewing Your Payments

After receiving stablecoin payments:
1. Open your wallet app
2. View your balance
3. See transaction history
4. The payment should appear within minutes

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I don't see my payment in my wallet">
    Make sure you're viewing the correct network and token. You may need to add the stablecoin token to your wallet's token list.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I entered the wrong address">
    If you haven't received a payment yet, update your address immediately. If a payment was already sent to the wrong address, contact support — recovery depends on the situation.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="What if I want to change wallets?">
    Add a new wallet in Toku and set it as your primary. Payments will go to the new address starting with the next pay cycle.
