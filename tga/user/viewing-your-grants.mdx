## Grant Types

### RTU (Restricted Token Units)
Tokens that vest over time. No payment required — once vested, you can claim them.

### Options
The right to buy tokens at a set price (strike price). You'll need to pay the strike price to receive the tokens.

### Warrants
Similar to options, typically offered to investors or advisors.

### Token Bonus
One-time token awards that may vest immediately or on a specific date.
