## What is Vesting?

Vesting is the process by which you earn the right to your tokens over time. Tokens in a grant don't belong to you immediately — you earn them as they vest according to your grant's schedule.

## How Vesting Works

### Example: 4-Year Vesting with 1-Year Cliff

A common vesting schedule:
- **Year 1** — No tokens vest (this is the "cliff" period)
- **After 1 year** — 25% of your tokens vest immediately
- **Years 2-4** — Remaining 75% vest monthly

If you receive a grant of 10,000 tokens:
- After 12 months: 2,500 tokens vest (25%)
- Each month after: ~208 tokens vest (1/48 of total)
- After 48 months: All 10,000 tokens have vested

## Key Terms

### Cliff
A waiting period before any tokens vest. If you leave the company during the cliff, you typically forfeit all tokens.

### Vesting Period
The total time over which your tokens vest (commonly 3-4 years).

### Vesting Frequency
How often tokens vest after the cliff:
- **Monthly** — Most common
- **Quarterly** — Every 3 months
- **Annually** — Once per year

View your grant to see a visual timeline showing:
- Past vesting events
- Upcoming vesting dates
- Tokens vesting at each event

### Vesting Calendar

## Vesting Status

| Status | Meaning |
|--------|---------|
| **Unvested** | Tokens not yet earned — still in vesting period |
| **Vested** | Tokens earned — available to claim |
| **Claimed** | Tokens you've already received |

---

## What Happens If...

### You Leave Before the Cliff
You typically forfeit all unvested tokens. Check your grant agreement for specific terms.

### You Leave After the Cliff
You keep tokens that have already vested. Unvested tokens are typically forfeited, though some grants have provisions for continued vesting.

### There's an Acquisition
Terms vary by grant. Some grants accelerate vesting upon acquisition ("single trigger" or "double trigger" acceleration).

## Claiming Vested Tokens

Once tokens vest, you can claim them:

1. Go to your grant
2. View available (vested) tokens
3. Click **Claim**
4. Confirm your wallet address
5. Submit the claim
