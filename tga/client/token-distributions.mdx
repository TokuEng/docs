## Tax Withholding

TGA automatically calculates and applies tax withholding when required:

- **Withholding rates** are configured per jurisdiction
- **Withheld tokens** are held separately for tax remittance
- **Net tokens** are sent to the recipient

### Viewing Withholding Details

Each distribution shows:
- Gross tokens (total claimed)
- Withheld tokens (for taxes)
- Net tokens (sent to recipient)

## Custody Integration

Distributions are processed through your connected custody provider:

| Provider | Settlement Time |
|----------|-----------------|
| Fireblocks | Near-instant |
| Anchorage | Same day |
| Coinbase Prime | Same day |
| Safe (Multi-sig) | After approvals |

## Transaction Tracking

After approval, track the distribution:

1. **Transaction ID** — Internal reference number
2. **Blockchain hash** — On-chain transaction hash
3. **Status updates** — Real-time status from custody provider
4. **Confirmation** — Final confirmation when complete

---

## Failed Distributions

If a distribution fails:

1. Check the error message in the distribution details
2. Verify the recipient's wallet address is correct
3. Ensure sufficient tokens are available in custody
4. Contact support if the issue persists
