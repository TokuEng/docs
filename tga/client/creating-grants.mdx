**Additional fields for Options:**
- Strike price per token
- Exercise window (when options can be exercised)
- Expiration date

### Warrants
Similar to options but typically issued to investors, advisors, or strategic partners.

### Token Bonus
One-time token awards that may vest immediately or on a specific date.
