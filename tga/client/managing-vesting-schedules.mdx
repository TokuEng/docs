## Overview

Vesting schedules determine when grant recipients earn the right to their tokens. TGA supports flexible vesting configurations to match your compensation strategy.

---

## Vesting Basics

### How Vesting Works

1. **Grant issued** — Recipient is awarded tokens
2. **Cliff period** — Initial waiting period (optional)
3. **Vesting begins** — Tokens start to vest on a schedule
4. **Fully vested** — All tokens are available to claim

### Key Terms

| Term | Description |
|------|-------------|
| **Cliff** | Period before any tokens vest |
| **Vesting Period** | Total time for all tokens to vest |
| **Vesting Frequency** | How often tokens vest (monthly, quarterly, etc.) |

## Common Vesting Schedules

### Standard 4-Year with 1-Year Cliff

The most common schedule for employees:

- **Total period**: 4 years
- **Cliff**: 1 year (25% vests at cliff)
- **After cliff**: Monthly vesting of remaining 75%

### 3-Year Monthly

Faster vesting with no cliff:

- **Total period**: 3 years
- **Cliff**: None
- **Vesting**: Monthly (1/36 each month)

### Quarterly Vesting

For investors or advisors:

- **Total period**: 2 years
- **Cliff**: None or 6 months
- **Vesting**: Quarterly (12.5% every 3 months)

### Milestone-Based

Tokens vest when specific milestones are achieved, rather than time-based.

## Modifying Vesting

### Before Acceptance
Vesting schedules can be modified before the recipient accepts their grant.

### After Acceptance
Once a grant is accepted, vesting schedules generally cannot be changed. To modify terms, you may need to:
1. Cancel the existing grant
2. Create a new grant with updated terms
3. Have the recipient accept the new grant

### Accelerated Vesting
In special cases (acquisition, termination, etc.), you can accelerate vesting:
1. Navigate to the grant
2. Click **Actions** > **Accelerate Vesting**
3. Select the acceleration date
4. Confirm the change

## Tracking Vesting Progress

Monitor vesting across your organization:

1. **Grant detail view** — See vesting progress for individual grants
2. **Cap table** — View total vested and unvested tokens
3. **Reports** — Generate vesting reports for accounting
