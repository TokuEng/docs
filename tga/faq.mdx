## For Grant Recipients

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="How do I see my grants?">
    Log in to TGA and click **Grants** in the sidebar. You'll see all grants issued to you with their status, vesting progress, and claim history.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="When can I claim my tokens?">
    You can claim tokens once they've vested. Check your grant details to see which tokens are vested and available to claim.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How do I set up my wallet?">
    Go to **Wallets** in the sidebar, click **Add Wallet**, and enter your wallet address. Make sure to use a self-custody wallet (like MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, or Phantom) rather than an exchange address.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What is a cliff?">
    A cliff is a waiting period before any tokens vest. For example, with a 1-year cliff, no tokens vest during the first year. After the cliff, a portion (typically 25%) vests immediately.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What happens to my tokens if I leave the company?">
    Tokens that have already vested are yours to keep. Unvested tokens are typically forfeited, though specific terms vary by grant agreement.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="How long does a claim take to process?">
    Most claims are processed within 24 hours. After approval, tokens are sent to your wallet. Actual delivery time depends on the blockchain network.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="Why is my claim amount less than expected?">
    Your organization may withhold a portion of tokens for tax purposes. Check your claim details to see the gross amount, withholding, and net amount.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="I don't see tokens in my wallet">
    Make sure you've added the token to your wallet. You may need to manually add the token using its contract address. Contact support if you need the token details.
  </Accordion>

  <Accordion title="What's the difference between vested and claimed?">
    **Vested** means you've earned the tokens but they're still in the system. **Claimed** means you've requested them and they've been (or are being) sent to your wallet.
  </Accordion>
