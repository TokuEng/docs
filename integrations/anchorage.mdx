## Distribution Workflow

When you run a token distribution through Toku:

1. **Toku calculates** — Determines amounts per recipient
2. **Request created** — Toku sends a transfer request to Anchorage
3. **Anchorage approval** — Your team approves in Anchorage (per your policy)
4. **Execution** — Anchorage executes the transfers
5. **Confirmation** — Toku updates distribution status

---

## Supported Assets

Toku supports distributions of any asset held in your Anchorage vaults, including:

- **Native tokens** — Your project's token
- **Stablecoins** — USDC, USDT, DAI
- **Other assets** — ETH, BTC (for applicable use cases)

---

## Vault Configuration

### Selecting Vaults

Choose which vaults Toku can access:

1. Go to **Settings** > **Integrations** > **Anchorage**
2. Click **Manage Vaults**
3. Enable or disable vaults as needed
4. Save changes

### Best Practices

- Use dedicated vaults for token distributions
- Keep operational reserves in separate vaults
- Configure vault-specific approval policies in Anchorage

---
