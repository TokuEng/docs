## Overview

To receive token grants or stablecoin payments, you need a crypto wallet. This guide walks you through setting up and connecting a wallet.

## What is a Crypto Wallet?

A crypto wallet is a digital tool that lets you receive, store, and manage cryptocurrency and tokens. Think of it like a digital bank account, but you have full control over it.

### Key Concepts

| Term | Definition |
|------|------------|
| **Wallet address** | Your unique identifier (like an account number) |
| **Private key** | Secret code that proves ownership (never share this) |
| **Recovery phrase** | 12-24 words to recover your wallet if lost |
| **Network** | The blockchain your tokens live on (Ethereum, Polygon, etc.) |

| Network | Wallet Address Format | Compatible Wallets |
|---------|----------------------|-------------------|
| **Ethereum** | Starts with 0x | MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow |
| **Polygon** | Starts with 0x (same as Ethereum) | MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow |
| **Arbitrum** | Starts with 0x (same as Ethereum) | MetaMask, Coinbase Wallet, Rainbow |
| **Solana** | Different format | Phantom |

<Info>
  For Ethereum, Polygon, and Arbitrum, you can use the same wallet address. These are "EVM-compatible" networks.
</Info>

## Security Best Practices

<Warning>
  **Never share your private key or recovery phrase with anyone — not even Toku support.**
</Warning>

### Do
- Write down your recovery phrase on paper
- Store it in a secure location (safe, safety deposit box)
- Use a strong, unique password
- Double-check addresses before saving

### Don't
- Store recovery phrase digitally (screenshots, cloud, email)
- Share your recovery phrase with anyone
- Use exchange deposit addresses for receiving payments
- Click links in unsolicited messages

## Exchange vs. Self-Custody Wallet

| | Exchange (Coinbase, Binance) | Self-Custody (MetaMask, Rainbow) |
|---|---|---|
| **Control** | Exchange controls your keys | You control your keys |
| **For payroll?** | Not recommended | Recommended |
| **Recovery** | Exchange can help recover | Only you can recover |
| **Fees** | May charge fees | Network fees only |

<Warning>
  **Do not use exchange deposit addresses** for receiving token grants or payroll. Use a self-custody wallet where you control the private keys.
</Warning>

## Troubleshooting

<AccordionGroup>
  <Accordion title="I don't see my tokens">
    - Make sure you're on the correct network in your wallet
    - Try adding the token manually (Import tokens)
    - Check the transaction hash on a block explorer to confirm it was sent
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I lost my recovery phrase">
    If you still have access to your wallet, you can usually view the recovery phrase in Settings > Security. If you've lost access entirely, the funds cannot be recovered.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="I sent tokens to the wrong address">
    Crypto transactions cannot be reversed. If you sent to a wrong address, the funds are likely lost. Always double-check addresses.
  </Accordion>
  <Accordion title="Which network should I choose?">
    Check with your employer or the Toku notification email to confirm which network your tokens will be sent on.
  </Accordion>
</AccordionGroup>
