|---------|---------|
| **Fiat Deposits** | Receive USD via ACH/Wire/SEPA |
| **Auto-Conversion** | USD to USDC on Base |
| **Virtual Bank Accounts** | Dedicated bank account per organization |
| **Crypto Transfers** | Transfer stablecoins to any address |
| **KYC/KYB** | Built-in compliance workflows |

## Prerequisites

Before configuring Bridge:

1. Bridge API key from Toku
2. Completed KYC/KYB verification in Bridge
3. Admin access to your TGA organization
