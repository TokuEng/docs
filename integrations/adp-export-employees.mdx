## Understanding ADP IDs

| ID Type | Description | Usage |
|---------|-------------|-------|
| **Position ID** | Unique identifier for an employee's position | Always present in payroll register |
| **Associate ID** | External employee identifier | Used with Position ID to post deductions |

<Tip>
Both Position ID and Associate ID are required to post deductions to ADP. The employee sync from Toku retrieves both IDs automatically.
