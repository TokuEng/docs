## Contractor vs Employee

Misclassifying employees as contractors can result in significant penalties. Key factors that distinguish contractors:

| Factor | Contractor | Employee |
|--------|------------|----------|
| **Control** | Works independently, sets own methods | Company controls how work is done |
| **Tools** | Uses own tools and equipment | Company provides tools |
| **Exclusivity** | May work for multiple clients | Typically works exclusively for one company |
| **Schedule** | Sets own hours | Company sets schedule |
| **Risk** | Bears financial risk | Company bears risk |

Toku provides classification guidance based on:
- Contractor's country
- Nature of the engagement
