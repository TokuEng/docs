## Exercise Process

### Step 1: Initiate Exercise

<Steps>
<Step title="View Grants">
  Navigate to your grants and select an exercisable grant.
</Step>

<Step title="Select Units to Exercise">
  Choose how many vested units to exercise.
  - Must be within vested amount
  - Consider tax implications
</Step>

<Step title="Review Terms">
  Review:
  - Strike price per unit
  - Total exercise cost
  - Settlement method
</Step>

<Step title="Submit Request">
  Submit the exercise request to generate DocuSign document.
</Step>
</Steps>

### Step 2: Sign Exercise Notice

1. DocuSign envelope created with exercise details
2. Document pre-filled with:
   - Recipient name
   - Grant details
   - Number of units
   - Exercise date
   - Payment method
3. Recipient signs electronically
4. Signed document stored

### Step 3: Admin Approval

Admins review the exercise request:

| Check | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| Vested units | Sufficient vested balance |
| Documentation | DocuSign completed |
| Payment | Payment received (if required) |
| Compliance | No blockers |

### Step 4: Settlement

After approval:
1. Tokens calculated (units - any tax withholding)
2. Settlement transaction created
3. Tokens transferred to recipient wallet
4. Exercise marked complete

## Strike Price

The strike price is the cost per token for exercise:

```typescript
// Exercise cost calculation
const exerciseCost = numberOfUnits * strikePrice;

// Example
// 1,000 units × $0.10 strike = $100 total cost
```

### Payment Methods

| Method | Description |
|--------|-------------|
| **Wire transfer** | Traditional bank payment |
| **Crypto payment** | Pay in stablecoin |
| **Cashless exercise** | Sell tokens to cover cost |

## Exercise Windows

Some grants restrict when exercises can occur:

| Restriction | Description |
|-------------|-------------|
| **Blackout periods** | No exercises during certain periods |
| **Exercise window** | Limited time to exercise after vesting |
| **Redemption hold** | Days to wait after vesting |

## Tax Considerations

Exercises may trigger tax events:

| Tax Type | Trigger |
|----------|---------|
| **Exercise spread** | Difference between FMV and strike |
| **Capital gains** | When tokens are later sold |
| **Withholding** | Employer may withhold taxes |

<Note>
Consult a tax professional for advice specific to your jurisdiction and situation.
</Note>

## Partial Exercises

You can exercise a portion of vested units:

```
Vested: 10,000 units
Exercise: 5,000 units

Result:
- 5,000 units exercised and settled
- 5,000 units remain available for future exercise
```

## Bulk Exercises

Admins can process multiple exercises in batch:

1. Select pending exercise requests
2. Approve in bulk
3. Settlement processes together

## Exercise Reports

- Pending exercises
